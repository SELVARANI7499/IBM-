Help me with my mood: The aim is to find a mood a person with the help of their social activities.Our idea is to develop an app similar to Facebook,Instagram etc. In this app we'll get the input from the user such as the social media which they oftenly use and the id of it. Then by signing in tis account with out App we get their activity such as the kind of posts they see and like fo a period of time and get it stored in our server.Generally a person see or search a post which is similar to their current mood.Hence by this we'll be able to get his/her current mood and if it is depressed,we notify them in our app with motivational posts which could be a solution or a reason to come out of that depession.
